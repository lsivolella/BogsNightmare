I hear indistinguishable noises outside my cabin. Thieves? Wild animals? Bog creatures? 

Could check it face to face through the front door or go around through the back, unseen. 

What should I do?
1. Open the front door and prepare to face what is doing all the noises.
2. Open the back door and sneak around the house to uncover the noises.
