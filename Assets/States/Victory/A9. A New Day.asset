  storyText: "You wake up to a warm sunny day. The grass is soft on the touch, and
    as you get up your body screams in pain. So, last night was really true? Judging
    from your wounds it all feels real. You see your flashlight and rifle scattered
    on the grass. On the spot where the creatures stood there is only a big burnt
    grass field. Besides all the craziness from last night you feel good inside.
    You make your way back to the cabin knowing that creatures like that will never
    show up again. \n\nDo you wish to try again? \n1. Yes, can't get enough of these
    Bog Creatures. \n2. No, I've already defeated the Bog Creatures once, no need
    to do it again."
