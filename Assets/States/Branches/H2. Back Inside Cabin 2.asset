  storyText: "Good choice! You don't even know what is going on, it's safer to stay
    inside. Except for the mice that came inside your cabin when you opened the door
    and are roaming around the place now, EW! You try to calm down, but the noises
    are getting worse. What is strange about the sounds is that the animals are not
    getting louder, something else is behind it\u2026 The death stench seems to be
    getting worse too. \n\nPerhaps staying inside is not all that safe? \n1. Stay
    inside anyway and find a place to hide. \n2. Might be safer to leave the cabin.
    Preparing to leave, you grab your rifle and a flashlight."
