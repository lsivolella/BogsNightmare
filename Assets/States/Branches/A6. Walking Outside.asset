  storyText: "You make your way away from your cabin. The night sky is an ocean of
    darkness and soon your flashlight is the only source of light. The death stench
    seems to be following you as you walk, but now there's something else filling
    the air. It's a weird sound, a silent laugh, a cold and mean giggle. You stop
    to listen better and realize the giggles are aimed at you. Something is coming,
    and deep inside you know it wants you to stop walking. \n\nWill you obey? \n1.
    Stand still. \n2. Hell no, I'm running away from this nightmare! \n3. Whatever
    this is, I'm going to fight it! Prepare your rifle."
