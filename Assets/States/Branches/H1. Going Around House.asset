  storyText: "You go around the house and come across the strangest scene you have
    ever seen. A flock of animals roaming on your yard. They look so scared! Three
    black bears huddle under the light post and don't let any of the other animals
    come near it. The deers that try to approach are received with wild roars. Raccoons,
    mice and wolves walk from side to side trying to find a place in the confusion.
    The death stench is also present here. You watch this scene mesmerized. What
    the hell is going on? \n\nWhat will you do? \n1. Turn around and go back to the
    backyard. \n2. Get inside though the front door."
