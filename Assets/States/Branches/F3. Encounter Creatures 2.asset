  storyText: "As you wait frozen in fear you hear them approaching. You look to your
    back and there they are, dark shapes in the night, the Bog Creatures! They really
    exist! The smell of death is overwhelming. Their laughter has turned into a crash
    of noises coming from all directions. They don\u2019t say a word and yet you
    know what they want. \u201CObey us\u201D, they whisper in your mind. \u201CBow
    your head\u201D. The whispers get more powerful. \u201CObey us\u201D, they demand.
    \u201CYou belong to us now\u201D. \n\nWhat are you going to do? \n1. Bow your
    head. \n2. Fight the creatures."
