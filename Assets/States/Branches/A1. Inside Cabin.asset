  storyText: "It's a cold night in the swamp. You are eating your supper when you
    hear indistinguishable noises outside your cabin. Thieves? Wild animals? What
    could it be? Could check it face to face through the front door or go around
    through the back, unseen. \n\nWhat should you do? \n1. Open the front door and
    prepare to face what is doing all the noises. \n2. Open the back door and sneak
    around the house to uncover the noises."
