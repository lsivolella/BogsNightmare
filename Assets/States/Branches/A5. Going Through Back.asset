  storyText: "Wise choice not to mess anymore with those animals. Those bears and
    wolves could kill you in a second! You open the back door and... nothing. There
    are no animals there, and the dim light outside make everything look suspicious.
    The death stench is now so strong it makes you stunned. \n\nShould you go back
    or move on? \n1. Move on. I need to get away from this place before it\u2019s
    too late. \n2. I\u2019m so scared! It doesn\u2019t seem to be safe anywhere!
    Go back inside and find a place to hide."
