    further, things get darker and more mysterious. You get a feeling that there\u2019s
    something going on up ahead, although you can\u2019t see it. Also, the death
    stench seems to be getting worse. \n\nAre you going any further? \n1. Yes, I
    need to figure it out. \n2. No, best to go back to the cabin."
