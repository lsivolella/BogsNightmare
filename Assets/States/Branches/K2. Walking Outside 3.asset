  storyText: "You continue the investigation when you hear something moving close
    to you. You look to your right and see a pair of terrible red eyes. You stare
    each other for a second and suddenly the pair of eyes leaps towards you, and
    something furry and heavy throws you to the ground. Up close, you can see the
    beast is a big black wolf, with tarnished teeth covered in tartar showing in
    a silent growl. As you lay on your back, frozen in fear, you hear a soft laughter,
    a cold and mean giggle in the air. \n\n1. Continue\u2026"
