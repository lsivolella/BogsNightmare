  storyText: "You open the front door, and to your surprise, there is a flock of
    animals roaming on your yard. They look so scared! Three black bears huddle under
    the light post and don't let any of the other animals come near it. The deers
    that try to approach are received with wild roars. Mice sprint frantically around
    the place and begin invading your house as soon as they see the light inside.
    Raccoons and wolves walk from side to side trying to find a place in the confusion.
    To make this scene even weirder, there\u2019s a strange smell in the air. A soft
    death stench that comes from all directions. \nYou watch this scene mesmerized.
    What the hell is going on? You could walk past the yard and check if something
    up ahead is making all the commotion or go back inside your house and lock the
    door. \n\nWhat will you do? \n1. Go outside and try to figure out what is going
    on. \n2. Stay inside and lock the door."
