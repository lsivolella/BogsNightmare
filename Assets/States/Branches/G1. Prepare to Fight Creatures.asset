  storyText: "You make your best fighting pose and wait... Even though you are shaking
    in fear, whatever is coming is going to feel your wrath! Soon you hear them approaching.
    You look to your back and there they are, dark shapes in the night, the Bog Creatures!
    They really exist! The smell of death is overwhelming. Their laughter has turned
    into a crash of noises coming from all directions. \n\nHow are you going to fight
    them? \n1. Sprint towards them and do a flying kick. \n2. Sway like a boxer and
    land a couple of hits on their heads."
