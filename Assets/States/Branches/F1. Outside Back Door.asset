  storyText: "You open the back door and see nothing in the backyard. The sky is
    a black sheet and the light of the cabin is not enough to light the yard. Noises
    come from the front of the house, but something else grasps your attention. A
    scent so strong it almost makes you pass out. It seems to be coming from all
    directions. It smells of death, making your body feel like ice. \n\nShould you
    run from the noises, or should you continue investigating? \n1. I don\u2019t
    care what\u2019s going on, I\u2019m going to leave this place. \n2. I need to
    find out what is going on. I will sneak around the house."
