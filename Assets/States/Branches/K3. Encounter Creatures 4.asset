  storyText: "You look to your right and there they are, dark shapes in the night,
    the Bog Creatures! They really exist! The smell of death is overwhelming. Their
    laughter has turned into a crash of noises coming from all directions. They don\u2019t
    say a word and yet you know what they want. \u201CObey us\u201D, they whisper
    in your mind. \u201CBow your head\u201D. The whispers get more powerful. \u201CObey
    us\u201D, they demand. \u201CYou belong to us now\u201D. \n\nWhat are you going
    to do? \n1. Bow your head. \n2. Fight the beast on top of you."
