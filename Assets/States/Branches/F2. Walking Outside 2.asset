  storyText: "Good idea not to chase the noises, those could only bring you more
    problems. You make your way away from your cabin. The night sky is an ocean of
    darkness and soon you can\u2019t see a palm from your face. The death stench
    seems to be following you as you walk, but now there's something else filling
    the air. It's a weird sound, a silent laugh, a cold and mean giggle. You stop
    to listen better and realize the giggles are aimed at you. Something is coming,
    and deep inside you know it wants you to stop walking. \n\nWill you obey? \n1.
    Stand still. \n2. Whatever this is, I'm going to fight it!"
