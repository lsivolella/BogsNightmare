  storyText: "You open the door and the only thing visible in the dark is a pair
    of terrible red eyes. The eyes hardly move, but a powerful growling comes from
    them. You also feel the presence of other creatures in the place, although you
    can\u2019t see them. They seem to be giggling, a cold and mean sound. They don\u2019t
    say a word and yet you know what they want. \u201CObey us\u201D, they whisper
    in your mind. \u201CBow your head\u201D. The whispers get more powerful. \u201CObey
    us\u201D, they demand. \u201CYou belong to us now\u201D. \n\nWhat are you going
    to do? \n1. Bow your head. \n2. Jump at the creatures and fight them."
