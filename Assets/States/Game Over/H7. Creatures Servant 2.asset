  storyText: "You wake up on the floor of your cabin. You feel empty, as if all the
    joy and happiness you ever had were robbed from you. The creatures can't be found
    anywhere, and the death stench seems to be gone too. They did something with
    you. You belong to them now, you know it. They let you live, but they are coming
    back, and you will have to obey their will when they come. \n\nDo you wish to
    try again? \n1. Yes, not sure I want to be a servant for the Bog Creatures. \n2.
    No, I'm fine serving the Bog Creatures."
