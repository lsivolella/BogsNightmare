  storyText: "You jump at the creatures, but the red eyes move fast towards you.
    You feel a terrible pain in your neck, and the taste of blood fills your mouth.
    You land on your back with the heavy beast on top of you. As the beast feeds
    on your flesh, you watch a pale blue light substance coming out of your body.
    The creatures are sucking your soul! As your soul abandons your body, your sight
    fades and you lie lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor. \n\nDo you wish to
    try again? \n1. Yes, this time I shall destroy the Bog Creatures. \n2. No, I've
    had enough of these Bog Creatures."
