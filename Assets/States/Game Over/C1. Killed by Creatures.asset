  storyText: "You aim your rifle at the creatures and shoot. The sound of the gun
    is absorbed by the night and the giggles turn into a mocking laughter. They rejoice
    in your defiance. You stand there, hopeless as they continue to approach. Soon
    they are too close, and you see a pale blue light substance coming out of your
    body. The creatures are sucking your soul! As your soul abandons your body, your
    sight fades and your body falls lifeless on the grass. \n\nDo you wish to try
    again? \n1. Yes, this time I shall destroy the Bog Creatures. \n2. No, I've had
    enough of these Bog Creatures."
