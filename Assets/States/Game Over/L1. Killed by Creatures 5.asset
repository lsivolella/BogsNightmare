  storyText: "You try to grab the wolf, but it moves too fast and torns your arm
    off. While lay hopeless on the ground and the beast feeds on your flesh, you
    watch a pale blue light substance coming out of your body. The creatures are
    sucking your soul! As your soul abandons your body, your sight fades and you
    lie lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor. \n\nDo you wish to try again? \n1.
    Yes, this time I shall destroy the Bog Creatures. \n2. No, I've had enough of
    these Bog Creatures."
