  storyText: "As you wait inside the wardrobe you start feeling a deep cold in your
    bones. Something very wrong is going on. The darkness of the wardrobe is invaded
    by a pale blue light substance coming out of your body. The creatures are sucking
    your soul! As your soul abandons your body, your sight fades and your body lies
    lifeless and forgotten in the wardrobe. \n\nDo you wish to try again? \n1. Yes,
    this time I shall destroy the Bog Creatures. \n2. No, I've had enough of these
    Bog Creatures."
